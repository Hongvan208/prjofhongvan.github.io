      <h2>💗 Remembering <span>Mr. Eric</span></h2>
      <p>
        Mr. Eric, the co-founder of <strong>Pacific Links Foundation</strong>, dedicated
        his entire life to supporting, protecting, and empowering thousands of
        disadvantaged students across Vietnam. He was not only a sponsor, but also
        a father, a teacher, and a guiding light for many of us.

  <section class="about">
    <h2>🌱 The Legacy of Mr. Eric</h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Eric devoted decades of his life to creating opportunities for students
      from rural areas, ethnic communities, and low-income families. His vision was
      simple yet powerful: <strong>"Education can change a life, and one changed life
      can change a community."</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      To many students, he was more than a sponsor; he was a mentor, a father figure,
      a guiding light, and a source of endless encouragement. He nurtured the dreams
      of those who had little hope, showing that dedication and compassion could
      transform lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      His kindness reached thousands of children across Vietnam, including me. His
      belief in the potential of every student continues to inspire us to work
      harder, dream bigger, and live with compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the toughest moments, Mr. Eric's vision remained unwavering. Through his
      programs and personal guidance, countless students were able to overcome challenges,
      gain confidence, and pursue higher education. His philosophy was clear: provide
      opportunity, instill values, and empower young people to lead positive change.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will always remember Mr. Eric with profound gratitude. His dedication, humility,
      and endless support have left a lasting impact not only on my life but on the lives
      of thousands of students who continue to follow the path he illuminated. His legacy
      of hope, education, and love will endure for generations.
